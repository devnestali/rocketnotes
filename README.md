# RocketNotes

📖 This is the front-end part of the rocketnote application, where 6 pages were developed for user navigation, making it possible to create an account, enter the application through the created account, access all previously created notes and tags, create a new tag and exchange profile information, such as photo and username. Later, this application will be integrated with the note API.
